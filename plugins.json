Of course, this concept itself isn\u2019t new. Plenty of great tools like 010, Hexinator and Synalyze It! have this feature (last two by the same company for different platforms). Thanks to the Kaitai Project not only for the project in general, but also for working with us to resolve some small issues while we were developing the plugin.",

It has turned into a functionally useful plugin in its own right. The snippet editor allows you to write small bits of code that might not be big enough to warrant the effort of a full plugin but are longer enough that you don't want to retype them every time in the python-console!\n\nAs an added bonus, all snippets are added to the snippets menu and hot-keys can be associated with them as they make use of the action system. All action-system items are also available through the command-palette (CTL/CMD-p).\n\n![](https://github.com/Vector35/snippets/blob/master/media/snippets.gif?raw=true)\n\n.",
