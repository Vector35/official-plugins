    "longdescription": "# Blob Extractor\r\nAuthor: **Vector 35 Inc.**\r\n\r\n_Binary Ninja plugin for extracting files from container formats_\r\n\r\n![preview](preview.png)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nBlob Extractor is a Binary Ninja plugin that leverages the [Unblob API](https://github.com/onekey-sec/unblob) to\r\nidentify and extract compressed archives, file-systems, and other blobs embedded in container binaries such as flash\r\ndumps or firmware images.\r\n\r\n## Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nThe following dependencies are required by this plugin:\r\n\r\n* [unblob](https://github.com/onekey-sec/unblob) - Python package for extracting files from container formats\r\n* libmagic - Native libmagic file type identification library\r\n* [python-magic](https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic) - Python bindings for libmagic\r\n\r\n### Darwin\r\n\r\n1. Install the `libmagic` native library\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew install libmagic\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Install the dependency Python packages for the Python version in use by Binary Ninja. If you are using your system's\r\nPython interpeter, these packages can be installed using PIP.\r\n\r\n```\r\npip3 install unblob python-magic\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Clone the repository into the Binary Ninja `plugins` directory\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:Vector35/blob_extractor.git \"/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Binary Ninja/plugins/blob_extractor\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\n1. Install the `libmagic` native library\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install libmagic1\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Install the dependency Python packages for the Python version in use by Binary Ninja.\r\n\r\n```\r\npip3 install unblob python-magic\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Clone the repository into the Binary Ninja `plugins` directory\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:Vector35/blob_extractor.git \"~/.binaryninja/plugins/blob_extractor\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nWindows is not supported by this plugin. Blob Extractor depends on `libmagic`, Unblob, and Unblob's extractor utilities.\r\nThese dependencies do not run on Windows.\r\n\r\n## Extractor Utilities\r\n\r\nUnblob uses external utilities for file extraction. After installing Unblob (via the installation instructions above)\r\nrun the following command to identify missing external extractor utilties:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> unblob --show-external-dependencies\r\nThe following executables found installed, which are needed by unblob:\r\n    7z                          \u2713\r\n    debugfs                     \u2717\r\n    jefferson                   \u2713\r\n    lz4                         \u2713\r\n    lziprecover                 \u2713\r\n    lzop                        \u2713\r\n    sasquatch                   \u2717\r\n    sasquatch-v4be              \u2717\r\n    simg2img                    \u2713\r\n    ubireader_extract_files     \u2713\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note: unblob is installed at `~/.local/bin/unblob` on Linux._\r\n\r\nMissing extractor utilities must be installed manually. Linux users can install the majority of the external\r\ndependencies using `apt`. MacOS users can use `brew`. Some of the external dependencies, such as `sasquatch`, must be\r\nbuilt from source. Blob Extractor will still run without external extractor utilities. However, it will be unable to\r\nextract certain blob formats. See the [Install Extractors](https://unblob.org/installation/#install-extractors) section\r\nfrom the Unblob documentation for more information.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n**The plugin icon is not appearing in the Binary Ninja sidebar**\r\n\r\nThis is most likely because the plugin dependencies have not been installed properly and the plugin failed to load. It\r\nis recommended to open the Binary Ninja log and see if there is a Python traceback originating from Blob Extractor. The\r\ntraceback should indicate what the issue is. If you are unable to run `unblob` from the command-line, it likely won't\r\nrun from the plugin either. Be sure to follow the installation steps above and verify that `unblob` and its dependencies\r\nare installed correctly by running `unblob --show-external-dependencies` from your terminal.\r\n\r\n**The plugin is not extracting any files, or extracted files are empty**\r\n\r\nThis is most likely because the required external dependencies for Unblob have not been installed. For example, if\r\nyou're extracting a flash dump that contains a squash file system, you must have sasquatch installed on your system. For\r\nJFFS2 you need jefferson, and so on. See the `Extractor Utilities` section above. Also reference the\r\n[Install Extractors](https://unblob.org/installation/#install-extractors) section from the Unblob documentation.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis plugin is released under an [MIT license](./LICENSE).",

    "longdescription": "# VirusTotal Plugin for Binary Ninja\n\nAn unofficial Binary Ninja plugin that integrates VirusTotal into reverse engineering and malware analysis workflows.\n\nThe plugin allows analysts to run VirusTotal searches and AI-assisted Code Insight analysis directly from Binary Ninja, without breaking their analysis flow.\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\n### Code Insight Notebook\n\nThe plugin includes a fully integrated **Code Insight Notebook** that brings VirusTotal Code Insight directly into Binary Ninja.\n\n- **AI-assisted analysis**  \n  Request summaries and detailed descriptions for functions from disassembly or decompiled views.\n\n- **Persistent notebook**  \n  Accepted analyses are stored locally and can be reloaded across Binary Ninja sessions.\n\n- **Editable results**  \n  Analysts can review and refine the AI-generated summary and analysis.\n\n- **Apply as Comments**  \n  Automatically insert accepted Code Insight summaries as function comments.\n\n- **Import / Export**  \n  Save the notebook to JSON or load an existing one to continue analysis across machines or collaborators.\n\n![Code Insight Notebook](images/vt_code_insight.png)\n\n---\n\n### String Search Integration\n\nStrings extracted from the binary can be browsed in a dedicated sidebar and queried directly on VirusTotal with a single click.\n\n![VirusTotal String Search from Binary Ninja](images/vt_search_string.gif)\n\n---\n\n### Code Similarity & VTGrep\n\n- **Search for bytes**  \n  Perform raw byte sequence searches in VirusTotal from the disassembly view.\n\n- **Search for similar code**  \n  Search for functionally similar code by wildcarding relocations and offsets before querying VirusTotal.\n\n- **Search for similar functions**  \n  Automatically detect function boundaries and search for similar functions without manual selection.\n\n![Code Similarity Search from Binary Ninja](images/vt_search_similar_code.gif)\n\n---\n\n> [!NOTE] \n> **VTGrep** searches rely on an active **VirusTotal Enterprise** session in your web browser.\n>\n> **Code Insight requires a VirusTotal API key** (free, no credit card required).\n>\n> - **Code Insight** only sends the selected function code for analysis.  \n>   The full binary is never uploaded as part of Code Insight requests.\n> - **Sample uploads** are optional and only occur if explicitly enabled during the initial consent prompt.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n### Recommended: Plugin Manager\n\nThe plugin can be installed directly from the **Binary Ninja Plugin Manager**.\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n1. In Binary Ninja, open the plugins directory.\n2. Copy the `vt-binary-ninja-plugin` directory into it.\n3. Restart Binary Ninja.\n\nIf installing manually, ensure that the `requests` module is available in Binary Ninja\u2019s embedded Python environment.\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\n### First-Time Run\n\nOn first execution, the plugin will prompt for consent to upload samples that are not already present on VirusTotal.\n\n- **OK**: Enable automatic uploads.\n- **No**: Disable automatic uploads.\n- **Cancel**: Disable the plugin for the current session.\n\nThis setting can be changed at any time from Binary Ninja settings.\n\n---\n\n### API Key Configuration (for Code Insight)\n\nTo enable **Code Insight**, configure your VirusTotal API key:\n\n1. Open **Settings**\n2. Navigate to **User \u2192 VirusTotal**\n3. Enter your API key in the `api_key` field\n4. (Optional) Adjust automatic upload settings\n\nAll preferences are stored in the Binary Ninja user configuration directory.\n\n![Setup VirusTotal API Key](images/vt_config.png)\n\n---\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis is an unofficial, community-maintained plugin and is not affiliated with or endorsed by VirusTotal or Google.\n\n\n### Changelog\nThis release adds Code Insight support to the Binary Ninja VirusTotal plugin.\r\n\r\nChanges in this version:\r\n- Integrated Code Insight Notebook for AI-assisted function analysis\r\n- Support for analyzing disassembled and decompiled functions\r\n- Persistent notebook with import/export functionality\r\n- Apply Code Insight summaries as function comments\r\n- UI and workflow improvements across the VirusTotal sidebar\r\n\r\nSome features require a VirusTotal API key or an active VirusTotal Enterprise session, as documented in the README.",
