        "longdescription": "# Sidekick\n\nSidekick makes reversing easy. Sidekick is an extension to the BinaryNinja desktop application supported by an AI-powered service that provides new capabilities to help users analyze and understand binary programs.\n\nThe Sidekick plugin is currently available as an official plugin from the Binary Ninja plugin manager.  The plugin will not be fully functional without a Sidekick service plan. To purchase a Sidekick plan, you must have a Sidekick account. To sign up for a Sidekick account, click <a href='https://sidekick.binary.ninja/sign_in'>here</a>.\n\n# Features\n\n## Accomplish Tasks Effectively\n\nWanting to explore the binary or analyze something specific? Sidekick comes with a powerful scripting workbench to help you quickly accomplish the tasks you care about. Just describe what you want and let Sidekick generate the script for you automatically.\n\n![analysis workbench](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-analysis-workbench.png?raw=true)\n\n## Answer Your Questions\n\nDon't know something about the code? Delve deeper into analysis of the binary as you drive discussions with the Sidekick AI assistant that possesses a vast amount of knowledge and code reasoning capabilities useful for reversing.\n\n![assistant](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-assistant.png?raw=true)\n\n## Generate Meaningful Names\n\nGood names convey meaning and help you immediately understand what something is. Without them, it takes valuable time to understand the code. Thankfully, Sidekick analyzes your code and automatically generates meaningful names for functions, structures, fields, and variables.\n\n![naming](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-naming.png?raw=true)\n\n\n## Visualize Behaviors\n\nTired of looking at busy, cluttered graphs to understand what the code is doing? Sidekick comes with the Code Insight Map view to help you quickly obtain a top-level understanding of the structure and functionality in the binary. Use this graph-based interface to selectively explore the content of and relationships among a focused set of topics.\n\n![code insight map](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-code-insight-map.png?raw=true)\n\n## Recover Structures\n\nWhen the code contains a lot of references to structures and fields, things can get rather cluttered with all of the dereferenced pointers, field offsets, and nesting going on. Let Sidekick clean up and simplify all that by automatically identifying and creating referenced structures through its sophisticated program analyses.\n\nBefore Structure Recovery\n\n![structure recovery before](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-structure-recovery-before.png?raw=true)\n\nAfter Structure Recovery\n\n![structure recovery after](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-structure-recovery-after.png?raw=true)\n\n## Show Points of Interest\n\nOnce you've found something worth keeping, it's nice to see and use it again. Sidekick allows you to store and organize items in the binary for easy reference using its Indexes feature.\n\n![indexes](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-indexes.png?raw=true)\n\n## Summarize Code\n\nSometimes the code you're looking at can be quite large and complex. Sidekick can help cut down on the time you spend figuring out the bigger picture by automatically summarizing entire functions with an informative comment. Also, when you're focusing on the finer details, Sidekick has you covered. It can quickly produce clear, descriptive inline comments that explain any logic you encounter.\n\n![comments](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-comments.png?raw=true)\n\n## Launch Investigations\n\nSoftware is complex and can take significant resources to analyze. Sidekick is equipped and ready for you to launch focused investigations of the binary, where Sidekick guides the analysis, looking for evidences of the topic you want to research.\n\n![investigations](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-investigations.png?raw=true)\n# Release Notes\n\nSidekick Client Revision: 2.0.183\n\n## Update Instructions\n\nIf you are updating from a current installation of the Sidekick plugin, then complete the following instructions based on the version of Binary Ninja currently installed:\n\nBinary Ninja version 4.2.5814 or later:\n\n* Open the Plugin Manager\n* Locate the Sidekick plugin\n* Click `Update`\n\nBinary Ninja version before 4.2.5814:\n\n* Open the Plugin Manager\n* Locate the Sidekick plugin\n* Click `Uninstall`\n* Restart Binary Ninja\n* Open the Plugin Manager\n* Locate the Sidekick plugin\n* Click `Install`\n\n## Release Changes\n\n* Fix: (Analysis Workbench) Fix error in checking the context builder type against a supported context. This fixes the 'enum' error when running Analysis Workbench script.",

        "longdescription": "EFI Resolver is a Binary Ninja plugin that automates the task of resolving EFI protocol type information, which supports both DXE drivers and PEI modules. It propagates EFI related pointers from entry point to where they are stored, (e.g. system table, MM system table, boot services, and runtime services). For PEI files, it also support identifies processor-specific PEI service pointers. The plugin also identifies references to the boot services, PEI services and MM protocol functions and applies type information according to the GUID passed to these functions. The plugin supports the core UEFI specification by default, and allows users to provide custom GUIDs and protocols.",

All action-system items are also available through the command-palette (CTL/CMD-p).\n\n![](https://github.com/Vector35/snippets/blob/master/media/snippets.gif?raw=true)\n\n.",

Note that the [community-plugins repo](https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins) contains a useful [utility](https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins/blob/master/generate_plugininfo.py) to validate the plugin.json. Additionally, the [release helper](https://github.com/Vector35/release_helper) plugin is helpful for more easily pushing new releases, incrementing versions, and creating the appropriate GitHub tags.\n\nNote that originally we recommended specifying the contents of this entire file inside of the [plugin.json](./plugin.json) but the latest repository generator will use the readme contents directly which means you should simply leave an empty longdescription field. \n\n## Minimum Version\n\nThis plugin requires the following minimum version of Binary Ninja:\n\n * 3000\n\n## License\n\nThis plugin is released under an [MIT license](./license).\n\n## Metadata Version\n\n2\n",
